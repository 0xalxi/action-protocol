# Spells

A mini game of magic. Spells can be `"cast"` on Witches (simple emoji nfts). Enchantments last for 5000 blocks, changing the background of the wizard.

Witches have covens, and can `"attune"` spells to their coven. When a spell is attuned by a witch, the sigil of that witch's coven is set in the bottom right of the spell.
